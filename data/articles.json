    "markdown": true,
    "content": "The **Piggian Empire’s national newspaper**, the *Porkyville Chronicle*, has entered a new age of publishing with the launch of its official online edition. For the first time in its storied history, the Chronicle’s pages will no longer be confined to parchment and ink — they will now be accessible from anywhere in the multiverse.\n\n## A Modern Imperial Gazette\n\nThe new website is designed to reflect the Chronicle’s traditional role as the **voice of the Empire**, while embracing the conveniences of modern technology. Visitors will find:\n\n- **Front page top stories** highlighting the most pressing events in Porkyville and beyond.\n- **Category sections** dedicated to *Piggian Empire*, *World*, *Politics*, *Economy*, and *Culture*.\n- A **searchable archive** of past stories, allowing readers to trace events back through time.\n- **Illustrations and documents** embedded directly in articles, bringing context to every report.\n\n![Front page screenshot](assets/images/frontpage-sample.png)\n\n## Reaching Across the Realms\n\nKaiser Live-van der Big praised the launch in an official statement, noting that *“an informed citizenry is the lifeblood of the Empire. With this new platform, the Chronicle ensures that every villager, from the western potato fields to the far edges of the Nether, has access to truth and knowledge.”*\n\nThe website also represents a new era of **international journalism**. With stories from the World Assembly, trade updates from faraway markets, and cultural features from across the multiverse, the Chronicle aims to broaden its scope while maintaining its imperial roots.\n\n## Tradition Meets Innovation\n\nWhile the Chronicle now appears in a digital form, it retains the stylistic elements of the imperial gazette: a bold masthead, drop caps at the beginning of articles, and sections demarcated with deep red rules. Readers can expect the same **editorial standards** that have defined the paper since its founding.\n\n> *“The Chronicle is no longer just a newspaper; it is a public forum, a record of history, and a stage upon which the Empire presents itself to the world.”* — Editorial Board\n\n---\n\n### Join Us Online\nReaders can now visit the Chronicle daily at **chronicle.porkify.net** to stay informed. As the Piggian Empire grows in influence, so too does the responsibility of its journalists to provide honest, timely, and engaging reporting.\n\nThis is only the beginning of the Chronicle’s digital journey — and the newsroom is already hard at work preparing the next wave of stories.\n"

    "excerpt": "The Monkey Kingdom and Kako Tsuki overwhelmed a fortified coalition in the End, raising fresh questions about war crimes and reparations.",
    "markdown": true,
    "content": "In one of the most brutal clashes the world has seen in recent memory, the **Monkey Kingdom**, allied with **Kako Tsuki**, secured a decisive victory over a coalition of the **Piggian Empire**, the **Kingdom of Kyara**, the **Kingdom of Ravenhold**, and **MIHOEN**. The battle, fought entirely on the **main island of the End dimension**, lasted a mere ninety minutes but left a deep mark on all participants.\n\n## Fortifications Overrun\n\nCoalition forces had prepared heavy fortifications across the central End island, determined to resist the attackers. Despite their defenses, they were unprepared for the **Monkey Kingdom’s deployment of Maces** — devastating weapons capable of delivering lethal blows even through fully enchanted Netherite armor. This technological and tactical edge quickly tipped the balance of battle.\n\nEyewitnesses described scenes of chaos as fortified lines buckled and defensive formations collapsed.\n\n## The First Casualty: A Reporter\n\nThe first life lost in the conflict was not a soldier but a **news reporter**, raising immediate concerns of **possible war crimes**. The Administration quickly launched an investigation into the circumstances of the journalist’s death, but it was quickly found that the news reporter had positioned themselves on the dangerous frontline, which lead to their untimely demise.\n\n## Treaty and Reparations\n\nFollowing the overwhelming defeat, peace was swiftly negotiated. However, the end of hostilities has not brought stability. Delegates of the Monkey Kingdom have reportedly traveled to **The Dominion** and the **Kingdom of Ravenhold** demanding **reparations** for the cost of war, with thinly veiled threats of renewed hostilities if their demands are not met.\n\nDiplomatic sources warn that these aggressive demands could fracture the fragile peace and spark **a new wave of conflict** across the realms.\n\n## A Fragile Peace\n\nWhile the Monkey Kingdom celebrates victory, the rest of the world watches uneasily. The short war has exposed the devastating potential of new weaponry, the vulnerability of even the strongest fortifications, and the perilous state of international diplomacy.\n\n> *“The war lasted only an hour and a half,”* an exhausted Piggian commander told the Chronicle, *“but the consequences may last for years.”*\n"

  "category": ["PE", "Economy"],
  "excerpt": "Generous wartime loans, vanishing reserves, and the closure of the Boarstone Exchange spark a sharp downturn in the Piggian economy.",
  "markdown": true,
  "content": "The Piggian Empire, fresh from its defeat in the **End War**, has now been rocked by a deepening **economic recession**. Officials confirmed that a wave of loans extended to the **Kingdom of Kyara**, intended to help the close ally build up their army for the conflict, has left the imperial treasury strained.\n\n## Vanishing Reserves\n\nThe crisis worsened when the government quietly **relocated the Empire’s gold and emerald reserves to an undisclosed location**. While no explanation was given, speculation ranges from fears of foreign seizure to internal instability. The move has rattled investor confidence and fueled rumors of a looming currency crisis.\n\n## The Boarstone Exchange Shuts Down\n\nIn another shock, all **physical branches of the Boarstone Exchange** — the Empire’s primary financial hub — were forcibly closed by government order. Markets across the mainland ground to a halt overnight, with only limited over-the-counter trading continuing in secret.\n\nMerchants and citizens alike have been left in disarray. *“I had my savings locked away in Boarstone bonds,”* one Porkyville shopkeeper told the Chronicle. *“Now I can’t even redeem them. What am I supposed to pay my workers with?”*\n\n## Economic Outlook\n\nEconomists warn that the combination of **unsustainable loans**, **vanishing reserves**, and the **paralysis of financial institutions** could mark the beginning of a prolonged downturn. Potato prices have already risen sharply in the western fields, while beef exports from the Empire have slowed due to shaken trade partners.\n\n## Political Ramifications\n\nOpposition voices within the Assembly are calling for an inquiry into the government’s handling of the crisis. Some accuse the Emperor’s ministers of **recklessly mortgaging the Empire’s stability** to maintain foreign alliances. Others argue that **supporting Kyara was necessary** to keep the Monkey Kingdom’s influence in check.\n\nAs uncertainty grows, the Empire’s citizens are left to wonder how long the recession will last — and whether the once mighty Piggian economy can recover its strength.\n"

Local authorities framed the initiative as a bold step to attract capital, expertise, and fresh ideas into the Empire’s historic capital.\n\n## Boosting Development\n\nThe announcement comes amid a broader effort by the Piggian government to **stimulate economic growth** and diversify the city’s infrastructure. By opening Pörkingsberg’s districts to outside funding, officials hope to accelerate the construction of new housing, commercial centers, and public works.\n\n> *“This is an opportunity for international partners to become part of our city’s story,”* said Deputy Mayor Anselm von Schwein. *“We want to see Pörkingsberg grow into a hub that reflects both our traditions and our openness to the world.”*\n\n## Opportunities and Concerns\n\nForeign builders will be able to bid for **long-term leases** on designated plots, with priority given to projects that align with the city’s development goals — including sustainable housing, cultural venues, and expanded marketplaces.\n\nHowever, some local voices have expressed concern. Critics worry that foreign investment could push up land values and make housing unaffordable for Pörkingsberg’s residents. Others fear that foreign architectural styles could overshadow the city’s imperial heritage.\n\n---\n\n### A City at a Crossroads\nWhether this gamble pays off will depend on careful regulation and continued cooperation between local leaders and their new foreign partners. For now, Pörkingsberg’s skyline is set to change — and the world is watching.\n"

    "content": "The **Porkyville Chronicle** is proud to announce that it is opening its pages to **foreign contributors**. Writers, reporters, and commentators from nations across the multiverse will now have the opportunity to publish their stories alongside the Chronicle’s own staff coverage.\n\n## A Broader Perspective\n\nWhile the Chronicle has long been the official newspaper of the **Piggian Empire**, demand for more diverse coverage has grown in recent months. So far, the **Kingdom of Ravenhold** has already showed interest in posting articles in the Porkyville Chronicle.\n\nDeputy Editor Brünn Schwein explained the shift: *“The world is interconnected. Decisions made in one nation can ripple across the multiverse. By welcoming stories from outside the Empire, we aim to give readers a richer, fuller understanding of global affairs.”*\n\n## How It Works\n\nForeign contributors may submit articles, reports, or opinion pieces to the Chronicle’s editorial team. Submissions will be reviewed for style, clarity, and adherence to the Chronicle’s editorial standards before publication.\n\nInterested parties are encouraged to **contact the Chronicle directly** for further information on how to submit their work. (In practice: please reach out to PorkyLIVE on Discord or [E-Mail us](mailto:porky@porky.live?subject=I%20have%20a%20story%20for%20the%20Porkyville%20Chronicle).)\n\n## Strengthening Dialogue\n\nThe Chronicle’s leadership views this initiative as a step toward building stronger ties between nations. By publishing stories written by foreign citizens, the newspaper hopes to foster dialogue, cultural exchange, and a better understanding of shared challenges.\n\n---\n\n### A Multiverse of Voices\nThe Chronicle invites all who have a story to tell — whether a report from the battlefield, a cultural feature, or a political commentary — to take part in this new chapter of journalism. The pages of the Empire’s newspaper are open wider than ever before.\n"
